# Creating Custom Slack Integrations with Vapor 3 (Redux)

This demo was part of a talk I gave at the [iOS Orlando Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/iOS-Orlando/) on [September 19, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/iOS-Orlando/events/253811627/).  This presentation was an update to a presentation I gave in January 2016, using Vapor 1 to create custom Slack integrations.  During the presentation, I gave a quick introduction to Vapor 3, talked a little about changes between Vapor 1 and Vapor 3, and then created this demo project to make a simple weather slash command.
